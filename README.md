# SublimeFilter
Adds commands for filtering lines in Sublime Text

The command "filter" (default hotkey alt+f) will allow you to collapse all lines not matching a given search string.
The command "filter_re" (alt+shift+f) does the same with the search string being a regular expression (using Sublime's default RegEx-syntax)

# Installation
Just copy the folder into Sublime's plugin-folder ("%APPDATA%\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\" on Windows) and you are ready to go.
